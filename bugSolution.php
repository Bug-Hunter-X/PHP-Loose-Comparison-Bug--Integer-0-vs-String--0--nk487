The solution is simple: use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`).  Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality. This prevents PHP from performing type coercion and ensures that the comparison is accurate.

```php
<?php
$user_id = 0; // Integer

if ($user_id === '0') { // Strict comparison
    echo "User ID is '0'";
} else {
    echo "User ID is not '0'";
}
?>
```
By using strict comparison, the code will correctly identify that an integer 0 is not the same as the string '0' avoiding the unexpected behavior caused by PHP's loose comparison.
