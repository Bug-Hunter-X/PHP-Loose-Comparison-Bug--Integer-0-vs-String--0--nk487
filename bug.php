This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparisons. The `if` condition checks if `$user_id` is equal to the string '0'.  Even though `$user_id` might be an integer (0), PHP's loose comparison (`==`) will evaluate to true because it performs type coercion.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're expecting strict type checking.
