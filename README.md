This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, bug in PHP related to loose comparisons.  The `bug.php` file contains code that incorrectly handles the comparison between an integer 0 and the string '0'. The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected code that uses strict comparison (`===`) to avoid the type juggling issue. This ensures that comparisons are accurate and prevent unexpected results.
